# Unit Converter

A unit converter created using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

Uses two input elements which update and automatically populate 
one another based on the value the user types and changes.

In addition, disables options dynamically to prevent both dropdowns having
the same values, provides error validation, and displays the conversion at
the bottom of the converter based on the units being calculated.

The current Measurement Types include:

- Area
- Speed
- Length
- Temperature
- Volume
